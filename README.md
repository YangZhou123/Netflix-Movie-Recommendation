Movie Recommendation System, SFU	                                   					         Oct-Dec 2016

This project was selected to be showcased during the launch event of KEY, SFUâ€™s Big Data Initiative, and the photo of me presenting this project to SFU's vice-president hit the headlines of SFU News!

Implemented a movie recommendation system that combined the big data ecosystem techniques such as Node.js movie-rating website, MongoDB, Apache Spark, Celery and Apache Hadoop cluster

Build the helper to allow Python Celery tasks to do work in a Spark job, which results in the whole system to update data periodically

Gathered user ratings periodically through Celery task queue to recommend interesting movies by using Spark MLlib ALS algorithm
